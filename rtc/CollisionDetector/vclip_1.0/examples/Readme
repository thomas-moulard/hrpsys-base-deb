Example programs that do not require the Inventor library



*** print

This program prints out the contents of the PolyTree library
after loading a PolyTree file.  For example, try:

	% print ../ptrees/simple.pt



*** allpairs

This program reads a file of the format:

	PolyTree file 1
	PolyTree file 2
	...
	PolyTree file N
	*
	body 1 spec
	body 2 spec
	...
	body M spec
	*

It then reads the specified PolyTree files, and then instantiates the
specified bodies.  Each body specification is the name of a defined
PolyTree and its pose in space.  V-Clip is then run on all pairs of
bodies.  For each pair, V-Clip returns the signed distance between the
objects, and the closest points between the object.  The coordinates
of each closest point are printed first in the local PolyTree frame,
followed by a slash, and then in the common global frame.  For
example, try:

	% allpairs ap1.txt
