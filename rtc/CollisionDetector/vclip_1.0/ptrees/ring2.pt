# This file demonstrates how to specify a compound PolyTree with a
# nested description.  Only the underlying atomic PolyTrees are
# referred to by name in the description of PolyTree ring.  The
# arrqangement of the hierarchy is specified by the poses and
# groupings within curly brackets in ring's description.  There is no
# limit to the depth of the nesting.

# Compare this file to ring.pt, which specifies an identical geometry
# for PolyTree ring, but builds up the geometry in stages.  The
# approach used in ring.pt has the advantages that it is easier to
# read and that it is more memory efficient (more instances of
# Polyhedra can be shared).  However, specifying PolyTrees as in this
# file may be more convenient at times.

# When nested descriptions are used, there are some PolyTree nodes
# without explicit names.  These are given the name "<internal node>".
