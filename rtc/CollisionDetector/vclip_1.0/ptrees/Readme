Sample PolyTree Files
---------------------

These files are used by the example programs and also serve as
models for using the default geometry reader described in the user's
manual.

grid.pt			unconnected grids of cubes
jack.pt			child's jack
mitsu.pt		beloved corporate logo
platonics.pt		platonic solids
platonics2.pt		platonic solids with faces automatically computed
ring.pt			boxy ring made of eight segments
ring2.pt		alternate way of defining the same ring
simple.pt		some very simple shapes
sixspike.pt		pointy thing
sphere.pt		high resolution unit sphere

If the Qhull library is not linked into the V-Clip library, then only
the files platonics.pt and sphere.pt may be read without a runtime
error.  The other files require Qhull, either to build compound
PolyTrees or to automatically generate faces of atomic PolyTrees.
